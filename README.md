This is a fully responsive personal portfolio website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It presents a professional overview with sections for projects, skills, education, certifications, and contact details. Designed with both desktop and mobile users in mind, the layout includes a collapsible sidebar, smooth section navigation, and a clean card-based structure for easy readability. It highlights academic and technical strengths while maintaining a modern, user-friendly interface.

What made this project interesting was implementing a complete tab-based navigation system without using any external libraries or frameworks. It was also satisfying to design a fluid layout using only native CSS and media queries. The most challenging part was organizing large volumes of content like education and project details in a way that still looked clean on all screen sizes. Future improvements could include adding downloadable resume support, dark mode toggle, and real-time project demo links. This project was a great way to reinforce front-end design skills and showcase personal achievements in a structured format.
